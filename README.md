Alright. Before we start off, some prerequisites:
1. This tutorial targeted at Go Developers who either have little to no prior or professional knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager).
2. It also assumes you have a professional knowledge of GoLang.
3. Some chill and enthusiasm. :)
